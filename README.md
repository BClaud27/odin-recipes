This is going to be a website that represents cooking recipes.

I have to build the initial html-boilerhead, the head followed by the body.
I have to use different commands and attributes.
I should use commits through out the progress, even for small changes (atomic commits)
I have to implent headers, lists, images, hyperlinks and so on...
