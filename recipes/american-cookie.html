			No funny ingredients, no chilling time, etc. 
			<br>Just a <strong>simple, straightforward, amazingly delicious</strong>, doughy yet still fully cooked, chocolate chip cookie that turns out perfectly every single time!</p>
		<h2>How to make American Cookies:</h2>
		<h3>Here is a <em>list of the ingredients</em> for 12 cookies:</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)</li>
				<li>¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted</li>
				<li>1 large egg</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
				<li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
				<li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)</li>
				<li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Step-By-Step Instructions:</h3>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
				<li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla
					, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and 
					remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
				</li>
				<li>Sift in the flour and baking soda
					, then fold the mixture with a spatula
					 <br>(Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen
					  resulting in cakier cookies).
				</li>
				<li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. 
					<br>For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. 
					The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
				</li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
				<li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet
					<br> leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm)
					 of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
				</li>
				<li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
				<li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
				<li><Strong><em>Enjoy!</em></Strong></li>
			</ol>
